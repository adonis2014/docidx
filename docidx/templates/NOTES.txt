To use Helm to install DocIndex, you first need to have two
persistent volumes defined:
1. scanneddoc - The shared volume where all the scanned documents reside
2. esbackup - A shared volume for search index backups


If you do not have these persistent volumes defined in your Kubernetes cluster,
create a file named document-volumes.yaml that contains the definition a shared
volume to use. An example with NFS might be:

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolume
    metadata:
      name: scanneddoc
      labels:
        volume: scanneddoc
    spec:
      accessModes:
      - ReadOnlyMany
      capacity:
        storage: 400Gi
      nfs:
        server: nfs.local
        path: "/home/documents"

After defining the volume, deploy document-volumes.yaml using
`kubectl apply -f document-volumes.yaml`

You will need a similar volume defined for your backups - repeat the same steps
to build a persistent volume named "esbackup."
