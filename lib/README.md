This directory is created to provide the OpenCV Java bindings, which will then leverage the native OpenCV system libraries.

The OpenCV Java bindings are built and distributed within this repository as opencv-340.jar. This is governed by licensing independent of docidx project itself.

OpenCV documentation and source is available at https://opencv.org
